## Background
A new program that will allow Sarasota and Manatee-county high schoolers and teachers to learn and apply science and technology skills through the mentorship of marine researchers at Mote.

The selected student and teacher members will explore oceanography, physics, chemistry, electronic circuitry and computer programming through real-world examples and applications — from deploying monitoring devices in local environments to working closely with Mote scientists using robotic gliders to monitor for harmful algae.
